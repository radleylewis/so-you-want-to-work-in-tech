# So you want to work in tech

## Overview

Inspired by my own personal [story](https://hackernoon.com/i-left-banking-for-tech-and-it-was-the-best-career-decision-ive-ever-made-2b9632uj), this accompanying code repository for *Switching to a Career in Technology: The Definitive Guied* which you can find [here](https://www.radleylewis.com).

Since pivoting into tech 3 years ago, I have been approached by dozens of smart, ambitious people of all ages and backgrounds, all with one common gripe: they are dissatisfied and depressed with their current profession. This guide is designed for those trying new things in the hope of discovering their passion. I will cover all of the steps I took to become a software engineer, and at by the end, my hope is you will know whether this could be something for you. 

This guide costs nothing, and any feedback is sought after.

Good luck!
